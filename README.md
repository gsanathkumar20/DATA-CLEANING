# README: Data Cleaning Project

## 📁 Project Title

**Data Cleaning with Python (Pandas and NumPy)**

## 📄 Description

This project demonstrates fundamental data cleaning techniques using Python libraries such as **Pandas** and **NumPy**. The provided Jupyter Notebook (`Data_Cleaning.ipynb`) guides you through handling missing values, identifying and resolving duplicate data, converting data types, and managing outliers.

## 🛠️ Requirements

To run the notebook, ensure the following libraries are installed:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy jupyter
```

## 📂 File Structure

```
├── Data_Cleaning.ipynb       # Jupyter notebook with data cleaning steps
├── data/                     # (Optional) Folder for raw or cleaned CSV files
└── README.md                 # Project overview and instructions
```

## 🔍 Features Demonstrated

* Handling missing values (e.g., `dropna`, `fillna`)
* Type conversion
* Identifying and removing duplicates
* Handling outliers
* Data inspection and summary statistics

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Open a terminal and launch Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

2. Open `Data_Cleaning.ipynb` in your browser.
3. Run each cell to explore the data cleaning process.

## 📊 Sample Data

The notebook either generates synthetic data or uses a CSV file. If you wish to use your own dataset, replace the data import section with your file path:

```python
df = pd.read_csv('data/your_dataset.csv')
```

## 📈 Output

Cleaned data ready for analysis or machine learning tasks. Summary statistics and visual inspection of cleaned values may be included.
